A Python module implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm as described in: Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010). Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents. In M. W. Berry & J. Kogan (Eds.), Text Mining: Theory and Applications: John Wiley & Sons. Initially by @aneesha, packaged by @tomaspinho.

### Installation ###
    pip install python-rake

### Usage ###
for external .txt files
take path as string datatype. words can be on same or different lines but must be seperated by spaces.

    import RAKE
    Rake = RAKE.Rake(<path_to_your_stopwords_file>); 
    Rake.run(text);

for lists:

    import RAKE
    Rake = RAKE.Rake(<list>); #takes stopwords as list of strings
    Rake.run(text);

`RAKE.SmartStopList()` and `RAKE.FoxStopList()` return the expected lists as lists, they can be used as shown bellow:

    import RAKE
    Rake = RAKE.Rake(RAKE.SmartStopList());
